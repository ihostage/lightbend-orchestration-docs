# Lightbend Orchestration

Lightbend Orchestration is a developer-centric suite of tools that helps you deploy [Reactive Platform](https://www.lightbend.com/products/reactive-platform) applications to Kubernetes and DC/OS. It provides an easy way to create Docker images for your applications and introduces an automated process for generating Kubernetes and DC/OS resource and configuration files for you from those images. This process helps reduce the friction between development and operations.

### Status of Lightbend Orchestration

Lightbend Orchestration is currently a Technology Preview. We encourage using this during development on Minikube, but integration with any other deployment targets including Kubernetes and DC/OS are currently at **Incubating** stage.
